# Python-Squared
Code Louisville Summer 2022 Data Analysis course project.

**Introduction**

This project, "Python Squared", is a representation of what I have learned during the course.
It was my decision to create a tutorial-esque program for users to learn about Python within
Python itself, so they can get instant results, understand concepts as they go, and feel more
engaged with the idea. It is interactive and contains multiple options for learning several
besic Python topics in a deep format that aims to keep it simple at the same time, from
printing words, understanding various types of lists (tuples, dictionaries, sets, etc.),
analyzing data (both preset and user-inputted), clearing data up and making it look cool,
and potentially more that gets the user a basic step into the ocean of Python, and might
help establish their interest in the field (or tell them this isn't for them).


**Project Feature List**

C1:
Make a list, dictionary, tuple, or other standard python data structure to read in data for your program.

C2:
Use built-in pandas or numpy functions to do things like remove 0’s and null values where they don’t belong in your dataset.

C3:
Use at least 5 different built-in Python functions to find out *something* about your data.

C4:
Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib, seaborn, or any other kind of visualization library that you think looks interesting.

C5:
If using some format other than a notebook, make sure your README explains your project.


**Required Packages**


-
**Instructions**
Download and install Python on your computer by going to [Python's download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
and downloading the latest release for your system (PC, Mac, Linux, etc.) Run the installer afterwards.

Then download this ZIP
Afterwards, open up a command prompt (on Windows, the standard prompt or Windows PowerShell will do)
and type "python" (without quotes) then hit Enter/Return.
