# Python-Squared
Code Louisville Summer 2022 Data Analysis course project.

**Introduction**

This project, "Python Squared", is a representation of what I have learned during the course.
It was my decision to create a tutorial-esque program for users to learn about Python within
Python itself, so they can get instant results, understand concepts as they go, and feel more
engaged with the idea. It is interactive and contains multiple options for learning several
besic Python topics in a deep format that aims to keep it simple at the same time, from
printing words, understanding various types of lists (tuples, dictionaries, sets, etc.),
analyzing data (both preset and user-inputted), clearing data up and making it look cool,
and potentially more that gets the user a basic step into the ocean of Python, and might
help establish their interest in the field (or tell them this isn't for them).


**Project Feature List**

C1:
Make a list, dictionary, tuple, or other standard python data structure to read in data for your program.

C2:
Use built-in pandas or numpy functions to do things like remove 0’s and null values where they don’t belong in your dataset.

C3:
Use at least 5 different built-in Python functions to find out *something* about your data.

C4:
Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib, seaborn, or any other kind of visualization library that you think looks interesting.

C5:
If using some format other than a notebook, make sure your README explains your project.

**Instructions**

Download and install Python on your computer by going to [Python's download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
and downloading the latest release for your system (PC, Mac, Linux, etc.) Run the installer afterwards.

Then download this ZIP from the main repo screen on GitHub by clicking the *green Code button* and selecting the bottom option,
"Download ZIP". Once downloaded, *unzip* it. My preferred method is [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html); download the
.exe for your system and install it. Then, *right-click* on the Python Squared ZIP in your Downloads folder and hover over
the new 7-Zip option. Click the submenu that says "Extract to 'Python Squared\'" and wait just a moment.
You can keep the folder wherever you want, but it'll be easier for the next part to place it on the *desktop*,
so move it there (click and drag, cut/copy and paste through the file explorer, whatever you prefer).

Afterwards, open up a command prompt (on Windows, the standard prompt or Windows PowerShell will do, this is
easiest by opening the Start Menu and searching for it).
Redirect where the prompt is looking by typing "cd "Desktop\Python Squared"" (without the outer quotes;
if you have the file somewhere else, redirect it there instead) and hit Enter/Return.
Your prompt is now where it needs to be, so type "python python_squared.py" (again, without quotes)
and hit Enter/Return.

From there, just follow the instructions as the script itself tells you! Enjoy!
